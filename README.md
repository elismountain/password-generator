## Password Generator

## Description
This is the solution for the challenge from EdX bootcamp, Week 5, Day 4.

The criteria I need to take into account are the following:

Generate a password when the button is clicked:
  1. Present a series of prompts for password criteria
   1.1. Length of password
   1.2. At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
  2. Character types
   2.1.Lowercase
   2.2. Uppercase
   2.3. Numeric
   2.4. Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  3. Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  4. Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
